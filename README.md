# Chesstool
Chesstool is an opensource desktop chess application that calculates the best possible moves you can make in a game of online chess. Currently, it only supports [chess.com](https://chess.com/); however I will be adding features (i.e. an intuitive UI) and additional sites like [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) and [chess24.com](https://chess24.com/). It is currently rated at 3438 ELO.

## Disclaimer
I am in no way responsible for the misuse of this program or advocating for unfair advantages. Using such a program in ranked chess play is unethical and will result in sanctions on your chess account. This project is not meant to aid cheaters but rather a way to educate chess players and to provide detailed in-game analysis. Please use this responsibly. (i.e. playing against friends in unrated games is permissible)

## About
Chesstool came about as a fun project to pursue to help me overcome my programming burnout. By combining my love for chess and devotion to programming I was able to create an application that utilizes the [Stockfish Chess AI](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish). My interest stems from the ingenious idea of marking chess pieces on the board which I discovered from [ChessBotX](https://chess-bot.com/). However, unlike ChessBotX, this tool is FREE and is meant primarily for education. The decision to opensource this project instead of putting it behind a paywall comes from my belief that the sharing of code -- no matter how insignificant -- serves to benefit society. I hope you will enjoy this project as much as I do!
